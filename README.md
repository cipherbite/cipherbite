### About Me:    
I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional with extensive experience in remote IT support and fiber optic infrastructure. I thrive on solving complex technical problems and ensuring smooth IT operations across various business units. My current focus is on cybersecurity, particularly involving programming, incident detection, and response, and leveraging SIEM tools.

In my free time, I explore the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3, crafting and analyzing smart contracts. You can also find me honing my skills in competitive coding challenges and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

### Social Media: ðŸ“¡    
Join me on Telegram, where I share insights, victories, and the occasional setback. Embrace the cyberpunk ethos with me.

### About Me:    
I'm a passionate data scientist with a knack for predictive analytics, specializing in recurrent neural networks (RNN) and LSTM models. I thrive on tackling regression tasks and exploring the fascinating realm of reinforcement learning (RL). Additionally, I have a strong foundation in classical machine learning and possess the requisite mathematical prowess.

Currently, I'm delving into the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3, where I'm actively engaged in crafting and analyzing smart contracts. During my leisure time, you'll find me honing my problem-solving skills on LeetCode and participating in CTF challenges.
